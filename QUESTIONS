Questions for the TA:
------------------------------
1) Is it a problem if we do not get/buy a real SSL certificate and 
   use a "home-made" one?
2) Can we just use our local webservers for Milestone 0?
3) If a doctor adds a medical record to a patient, do they automatically
   get viewing priviledge?
