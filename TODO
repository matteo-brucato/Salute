Use this file as a list for simple things to do
-----------------------------------------------

CONNECTIONS/PERMISSIONS/MEDRECS
- when changing level for a connection, if connection goes from low to high, add permissions to all medical records

DOCUMENTATION
- add a glossary in the documentation
- describe bettere how MVC has been implemented (structure of folders and files)
- mention about test performance (CodeIgniter is very fast and each controller has a streightforward flow)
- add a (possibly big) list with all the possible changes that we anticipate.
  just to show that we are taking care of that aspect
- go to github and for each issue reported do one of the following:
    - fix the bug
    - report the bug in the documentation

PROFILE
- Implement pictures and related information

MEDICAL RECORDS
- add a view for patients to see his/her connected patients medical records
  (maybe it can be added to the patient's profile...)

GROUPS
- create is_invited table, to be able to verify whether someone trying to join a private group came via invitation.
- logic checking:
	- if patient only: should not be allowed to invite a hcp
	- if hcp only: should not be allowed to invite a patient
- Make one view, general, to see groups, instead of having mygroups and
  groups, that are basically the same thing
- When listing group members, just use the already existing views to
  list patients and doctors (unless there is a specific reason to have
  a new view).

PRESENTATION
- Prepare a list of actions to perform during the presentation (we all need to do that, I think)
... (my memory is bad...)
