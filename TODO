Use this file as a list for simple things to do
-----------------------------------------------

GENERAL:
//- It shouldn't be:
//     $this->ui->set($this->members('list', $group_id));
//  but simply
//     $this->members('list', $group_id);
//  and the same in all other cases. The idea is that you call the controller
//  method and then it will load the main panel, eventually.

============================================================================================================================================

Public/Private 
//- fix patient / hcp search list (take into account private/public setting in accounts table)
//- change connection requests: deny if the receiver account is private ## 

============================================================================================================================================

CONNECTIONS/PERMISSIONS/MEDRECS:
//- when changing level for a connection, if connection goes from low to high, add permissions to all medical records ##MATTEO##

============================================================================================================================================

PROFILE: ##ASHWIN ##
- Implement pictures ## ASHWIN ##

//- Profile shortcut from NavBar fails to load sidepanel ## MATTEO ##

- DECISION:
-- Controller General Logic:
		if(connected)
			show related profile
		else if (not connected) 
			if (private)
				deny
			else 
				show public profile
					
-- IN SUMMARY : 8 scenarios needed 
	
**	curr_user-->id_to_give_to_controller_fn // view name
	
	hcp-->hcp // hcp_to_hcp_related_profile 
	hcp-->pat // hcp_to_pat_related_profile
	pat-->hcp // pat_to_hcp_related_profile
	pat-->pat // pat_to_pat_related_profile
	no_conn-->pat // deny if patient is private. else pat_public_profile (name and picture)
	no_conn-->hcp // hcp_public_profile (picture and everything)
	hcp // hcp_personal_profile
	pat	// pat_personal_profile

============================================================================================================================================

MEDICAL RECORDS:
//- add a view for patients to see his/her connected patients medical records
//  (maybe it can be added to the patient's profile...)

============================================================================================================================================

GROUPS:
//create is_invited table, to be able to verify whether someone trying to join a private group came via invitation.
//logic checking:
//	- if patient only: should not be allowed to invite a hcp 
//	- if hcp only: should not be allowed to invite a patient
//- add data: groups.txt invite.txt 
// Make one view, general, to see groups, instead of having mygroups and groups, that are basically the same thing 
// in the member list, it gives you the option to 'request connection' this doesnt check if they are already 
//	connected/have been requested already

/*When listing group members, just use the already existing views to
  list patients and doctors (unless there is a specific reason to have
  a new view). REPLY :: I was going to...BUT due to some difficulties, it doesnt really work so easily, and its 
  really not that important. 
*/

//- Edit group does not work well... I change something and it says "all fields mandatory"
//- Also, it has that strange behaviour in dislpaying the description...
// bug : I can join a private group just with the URL...

/*- Should a hcp be able to see "patient only" groups in the group listing?
    (similarly, should a patient be able to see "hcps only" ones?) */

//- Edit group does not work well... I change something and it says "all fields mandatory"
//- Also, it has that strange behaviour in dislpaying the description...

// create error message for when an ivitation is received twice

//- create invitation list
// bug: doesnt correctly display member permission
// fix sample data...
// create test set  ##NADA##

============================================================================================================================================

DOCUMENTATION: ## LAST THING SINCE ITS NOT DUE TILL 15th ##
//- added documentation for database test data

//- added documentation for USER MANUAL:
//	-HCP user manual:
//		-Using the side pannel
//			-Added: My Groups, My group invitations, Create a new group, All groups; 
//                  My referrals, Create referral
//		-How-to's
//			-Added: Create a referral; 
//                  Delete a referal;
//                  Change picture; 
//                  Delete picture;
//                  List all patient/hcps

-add how-to's for group stuff

//	-PATIENT user manual:
//		-Using the side pannel
//			- Added: My referrals, under My HCPs; 
//                   My Patient Friends, Pending incoming, Pending outgoing; 
//                   My Groups, My group invitations, Create a new group, All groups
//		-How-to's
//			-Added: Request an appointment
//                  Change\view shared medical records per hcp;
//                  Change\view shared medical records per medical record;
//                  Change connection level;
//                  Accept a referral;
//                  Delete a referral;
//                  Change privacy level;
//                  Change picture;
//                  Delete picture;
//                  List all patient/hcps

- add how-to's for patient to patient stuff and group stuff
			
- add a glossary in the documentation
- explain PUBLIC/PRIVATE accounts:
    - ONLY applicable to patients, NOT hcps 
    - Patient's who have a private profile are in summary: users who only want to send requests themselves, they cannot
	  receive connection requests. They can receive referals and group invitations ONLY becasue they are received from their
	  connected friends/hcps. If private patient joins a group, they will be listed in the group members list; this is because
	  if they want to be part of the group, they only want to be public in that group.
- describle protection of /resource folder: .htaccess to deny access to all resources inside, then the 'download' controller that reads
  files in a php file and gives a response to the client setting the mime type. this is for medical records and account images for now
- describe bettere how MVC has been implemented (structure of folders and files)
- mention about test performance (CodeIgniter is very fast and each controller has a streightforward flow)
- add a (possibly big) list with all the possible changes that we anticipate.
  just to show that we are taking care of that aspect
- go to github and for each issue reported do one of the following:
    - fix the bug
    - report the bug in the documentation
- FUTURE FEATURE: 'type' in permissions table: 0 is download only 1 is also delete

============================================================================================================================================

PRESENTATION:
//- Prepare a list of actions to perform during the presentation (we all need to do that, I think)
