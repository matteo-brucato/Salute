Use this file as a list for simple things to do
-----------------------------------------------
AJAX
- I think its a little broken... doesn't reload when you do an action. Changes are only shown when you hit refresh. 

CONNECTIONS/PERMISSIONS/MEDRECS
- when changing level for a connection, if connection goes from low to high, add permissions to all medical records
- 'type' in permissions table: 0 is read access 1 is read+write access => change all models/fns that use permissions
	to take this new case into account. 

DOCUMENTATION
- add a glossary in the documentation
- describe bettere how MVC has been implemented (structure of folders and files)
- mention about test performance (CodeIgniter is very fast and each controller has a streightforward flow)
- add a (possibly big) list with all the possible changes that we anticipate.
  just to show that we are taking care of that aspect
- go to github and for each issue reported do one of the following:
    - fix the bug
    - report the bug in the documentation

PROFILE
- Implement pictures and related information
- Profile shortcut from NavBar fails to load sidepanel

GROUPS
- create is_invited table, to be able to verify whether someone trying to join a private group came via invitation.
- logic checking:
	- if patient only: should not be allowed to invite a hcp
	- if hcp only: should not be allowed to invite a patient

- Make one view, general, to see groups, instead of having mygroups and
  groups, that are basically the same thing
  
  REPLY by Nada: I disagree, 'Groups' shows all groups that are publice (including ones you are not in,
				 and might want to join), 'My Groups' lists the groups you are actually a member of (showing both 
				 private and public)

- When listing group members, just use the already existing views to
  list patients and doctors (unless there is a specific reason to have
  a new view).
  REPLY by Nada: There are additional features depending on your permission level. Ex:delete member, change perms,etc

- When click on create group, side panel dissapears! Needs fixing...


PRESENTATION
- Prepare a list of actions to perform during the presentation (we all need to do that, I think)
... (my memory is bad...)
