\subsection{Database Design}
\paragraph{PostgreSQL}
Salute uses PostgreSQL 8.4 as its database management software.
\paragraph{Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)}
try to place the ER here
\paragraph{Entities & Attributes}
Entities are represented in the ER diagram as rectangles.  Each entity represents a table in the database that holds all of the information or attributes that represents that entity.  In the ER diagram, each attribute is represented with a oval.
\subparagraph{Messages}

\subsection{MVC Design}

MVC stands for Model View Controller, and is a software architecture and an architectural pattern in software engineering. The purpose is to separate a system into parts,assigns responsibilities to each, and ensures that they can work together. This design method strives to anticipate for future changes.

\section{Tests}

\subsection{Controller Tests}

\paragraph{} 
There are three types of users: non-members, patients, and health care providers. Each type have been tested individually.

A non-member should only be able to view the default home page, or register. All other functions were tested to assure that a non-member could not access any other functionalities. 

A patient is able to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Login, Logout
\item Requesting a connection with a healthcare provider
\item Delete a connection with their healthcare provider
\item Viewing all, pending, or connected healthcare providers
\item Viewing their medical records
\item Make an appointment with a connected doctor
\item Cancel an appointment 
\item View all,upcoming, or past appointments
\item Change their email, or password
\item Retrieve their password if forgotten via email
\item Edit their information
\item Deactivate, reactivate their account
\item View all, current, or past bills.
\item Pay their bills (Note: This is not linked to any credit card/bank system ) 
\item Add or delete a medical record
\item View all their medical records
\item Set each medical record to hidden or public to specific healthcare providers
\end{itemize}
A health care provider is able to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Login, Logout
\item Requesting a connection with a healthcare provider
\item Accept a connection request from another health care provider or patient
\item Reject a connection request from another health care provider or patient
\item Delete a connection with their patient or collegue
\item Viewing all healthcare providers
\item Viewing pending incoming requests with other healthcare providers
\item Viewing pending outgoing requests with other healthcare providers
\item Viewing connected collegues, and patients
\item Accept a requested appointment from their patients
\item Cancel an existing appointment
\item View all,upcoming, and past appointments
\item Change their email or password
\item Retrieve their password if forgotten via email
\item Edit their information
\item Deactivate, and reactivate their account
\item View all, current, or past bills.
\item Issue bills to connected patients
\item Add a medical record to a specific patient
\item Viewing their patient's medical records (the ones they are authorized to see)
\item Set each medical record to hidden or public to specific healthcare providers
\end{itemize}
