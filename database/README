** To start and load the database **
cd into script/ directory and run ./start_database.sh
Before doing this operation it is necessary to change the file 
tables/load_data.sql, modifying the paths in which every data file
actually resides.

** PLEASE NOTE **
Since we all have different content inside load_data.sql, let's
remove it from our repository. You can still keel this file into
your local copy of the repository, but don't add it to git. Instead,
do "git rm" to removit from the tracked files.

** To drop and stop the database **
cd into script/ directory and run ./delete_database.sh
** NOTE: If you are using a virtual machine and you don't turn it off,
but save the session with VirtualBox, you can skip this passage and
leave your database always alive!
